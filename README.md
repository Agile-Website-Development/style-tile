This page just demonsrates the possible idea for sorting profile images, more specificlaly for leadership pages but could be applied to other profile based pages too. 


You shouldn't have to run Node.js for it to work, I'm just using Node since I'm using the free version of MAMP and it only supports one address at a time. 


Either pull the stuff out of the public folder or in terminal, 


1. cd into the folder.
2. 2. run forman start. 


It'll start a new server at localhost:5000
